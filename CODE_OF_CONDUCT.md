this project a welcoming, respectful, and constructive experience for everyone,
regardless of background or identity.

- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
- Trolling or deliberately inflammatory remarks
