## JAAG – JSON input file Assembler for AlphaFold 3 (with Glycan Integration)

JAAG is a lightweight, web-based GUI tool that helps generate AlphaFold 3 input
JSON files with integrated glycan support. It automates the creation of correct
glycan syntax (including `bondedAtomPairs` + CCD), reducing manual errors when
preparing glycoprotein or glycan–protein systems.
