# How to Contribute

We welcome small patches related to bug fixes and documentation, but we do not
plan to make any major changes to this repository.

## AI Generated Code

We welcome the use of AI tools for the generation of code, documentation and/or
Pull Request (PR) description as long as:

1.  It has been transparently labelled as such. Make sure to declare it in the
    PR message.
2.  You have manually reviewed the code before sending the PR.
3.  The change has been manually tested. We might ask you to fold a certain
    input to check correctness of the PR.

Please do not submit AI generated PRs where test results have been hallucinated.
